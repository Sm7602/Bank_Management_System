# 🏦 Bank Management System

A **console-based Bank Management System built with Java** that demonstrates core Object-Oriented Programming concepts, account management, deposits, withdrawals, balance tracking, transaction history, input validation, and custom exception handling.

This project was developed as part of the **Auspify Internship – Task 4 (Medium)**.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

The **Bank Management System** is a Java-based console application designed to simulate basic banking operations.

Users can:

* Create new bank accounts
* Deposit money
* Withdraw money
* Check account balance
* View account details
* View complete transaction history
* View all registered accounts
* Exit the application safely

The application uses an in-memory `HashMap` to manage accounts and `ArrayList` to maintain transaction history.

---

## 🧠 Core Java Concepts Demonstrated

This project focuses heavily on fundamental Java and OOP concepts.

### 1. Encapsulation

Class fields are kept private and accessed through controlled methods.

```java
private final String accountNumber;
private final String customerName;
private BigDecimal balance;
```

This protects account information from uncontrolled external modification.

---

### 2. Abstraction

Banking operations are exposed through simple methods such as:

```java
deposit()
withdraw()
checkBalance()
findAccount()
```

The internal implementation details remain inside the respective classes.

---

### 3. Composition

An `Account` contains a collection of `Transaction` objects.

```java
private final List<Transaction> transactionHistory;
```

This creates a clear relationship between an account and its transaction history.

---

### 4. Enum

Transaction types are represented using an enum:

```java
public enum TransactionType {
    DEPOSIT,
    WITHDRAWAL
}
```

This avoids using unreliable string values for transaction types.

---

### 5. Collections

The project uses:

```java
Map<String, Account>
```

for account management and:

```java
List<Transaction>
```

for transaction history.

---

### 6. BigDecimal for Money

`BigDecimal` is used instead of `double` for financial calculations.

```java
private BigDecimal balance;
```

This is a better approach for monetary values because floating-point arithmetic can introduce precision problems.

---

### 7. Custom Exception Handling

The application defines dedicated exceptions:

* `AccountNotFoundException`
* `DuplicateAccountException`
* `InsufficientBalanceException`
* `InvalidAmountException`

This keeps banking-related error handling meaningful and organized.

---

## 🏗️ Project Architecture

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure Java is installed on your system.

Recommended:

```text
Java 17+
```

Verify your Java installation:

```bash
java -version
```

---

## ▶️ Running the Project

### Option 1: Eclipse

1. Open **Eclipse IDE**
2. Select **File → Import**
3. Import the project as an existing Eclipse project
4. Open:

```text
src/bank_management_system/Main.java
```

5. Run `Main.java`

---

### Option 2: Command Line

Navigate to the project's `src` directory and compile the source files.

```bash
javac -d ../bin src/module-info.java src/bank_management_system/*.java src/bank_management_system/exception/*.java
```

Then run:

```bash
java -cp bin bank_management_system.Main
```

> If your Java version/module configuration differs, running `Main.java` directly from Eclipse is the simplest option.

---

## 🛡️ Exception Scenarios

### Duplicate Account

If an account number already exists:

```text
DuplicateAccountException
```

---

### Account Not Found

If the requested account does not exist:

```text
AccountNotFoundException
```

---

### Insufficient Balance

If a customer attempts to withdraw more than the available balance:

```text
InsufficientBalanceException
```

---

### Invalid Amount

Invalid transaction amounts are rejected through:

```text
InvalidAmountException
```

---

## 📊 Data Management

The application currently uses **in-memory data structures**.

### Account Storage

```java
private final Map<String, Account> accounts;
```

Implemented using:

```java
HashMap
```

### Transaction Storage

Each account maintains:

```java
private final List<Transaction> transactionHistory;
```

Implemented using:

```java
ArrayList
```

### Important Limitation

This version **does not use a database or file persistence**.

Therefore, all account and transaction data is lost when the application terminates.

This is intentional for this console-based internship task.

---

## 🔐 Design & Code Quality

The project follows several good development practices:

* Private class fields
* `final` fields where appropriate
* Dedicated classes for different responsibilities
* Custom exceptions
* Immutable transaction properties
* `BigDecimal` for financial calculations
* Unmodifiable transaction history exposure
* Input validation
* Meaningful method names
* Enum for transaction types
* UUID-based transaction identifiers

For example, transaction history is exposed safely:

```java
return Collections.unmodifiableList(transactionHistory);
```

This prevents callers from directly modifying the account's internal transaction list.

---

## ⚠️ Current Limitations

This project is a **console-based educational banking system**, not a production banking application.

Current limitations include:

* No database persistence
* No user authentication
* No password/PIN management
* No fund transfer between accounts
* No account deletion
* No account update functionality
* No interest calculation
* No loan management
